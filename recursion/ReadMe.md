  **What is Recursion?**
                  
*We can solve some problems by reducing them into smaller problems of the same type, and in computer science, it is implemented using a function. Any function calls itself is called recursion, and it solves a problem by calling a copy of itself to work on a smaller problem.  
When we think of reducing a problem into smaller problems, few questions arise.*

* How can we divide a problem into a smaller problem?

* How many subproblems do we need?

*When solving recursion, it is essential to terminate the recursion. Otherwise, it will reduce a problem into a subproblem like an infinite loop and lead to a stack overflow. So, we can have as many subproblems as we need but requires a base condition that eventually terminates the process.*
