**Arrays Vs Linked List**

*The data structure is a way we store the data in Random-access memory(RAM) to make the algorithm efficient. Computers keep temporary data in RAM while executing the program, either on the heap (all the global variables) or on the stack (all variable declared inside the method or the function).*


*The difference between arrays and the linked list is how it gets stored in the main memory. An array is a data structure that keeps the collection of the same type of data in contiguous memory. For example, if an array needs to store five items, the compiler will acquire five adjacent memory blocks. This property gives the advantage of direct indexing an element at a specific position in a constant time called random-access, and because of the same reason, the size of the array should be of fixed length.*

*But what if instead of ten items, we need to store 1000 items in an array. And here, the linked list comes into the picture. LinkedList doesn't keep the element in contiguous memory but rather at a random location. Each element in the list stores the next element's address, which makes it dynamic in size.*
